# project-0: Foodie Match

This was a group project that was completed over a 4 day period.  Foodie Match was designed around the concept of personallity tests found online, where a user is given different questions and the application uses the user's answers to those questions to determine the user's personallity.  Instead of identifying the user's personallity, Foodie Match identifies an appropriate restaurant the user might like based on the given questions.

## How-it-works

The user arrives at the landing page.  The user clicks the 'Start the Quiz' button and is taken to the the quiz page.  After answering the 4 questions, the user submits their answer by clicking submit.  Each answer has a different unique value.  By clicking submit, those values are matched to a restaurant, and the user is taken to that restaurant's landing page.
